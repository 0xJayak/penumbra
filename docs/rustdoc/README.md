This directory is empty except for the firebase config file we use to deploy
rustdoc output, because the contents of the documentation are inline with the
source code.  We use it to stage the rustdoc output for deployment in CI.

The `index.html` can only be generated using nightly Rust, which we want to
avoid in CI, because (1) it interferes with caching and (2) sometimes causes
breakage.  Instead, when the list of built crates in the `notes.yml` workflow
changes, it can be regenerated by running
```
RUSTDOCFLAGS="--enable-index-page -Zunstable-options" cargo +nightly doc  --no-deps \ ... # paste the rest of the command from notes.yml
```
and then copying `target/doc/index.html` into this directory.
