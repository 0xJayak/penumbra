Penumbra is a fully private proof-of-stake network providing privacy to the
Cosmos ecosystem.

Penumbra integrates privacy with proof-of-stake through a novel private
delegation mechanism that provides staking derivatives, tax-efficient staking,
and on-chain governance with private voting. Penumbra connects to the Cosmos
ecosystem via IBC, acting as an ecosystem-wide shielded pool and allowing
private transactions in any IBC-compatible asset.  Users can also swap these
assets using ZSwap, a private decentralized exchange supporting sealed-bid batch
auctions and Uniswap-v3-style concentrated liquidity.  Sealed-bid batch auctions
prevent frontrunning, provide better execution, and reveal only the net flow
across a pair of assets in each block, and liquidity positions are created
anonymously, allowing traders to approximate their desired trading function
without revealing their individual beliefs about prices.
