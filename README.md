Penumbra is an research project towards a design for a fully private
proof-of-stake network interoperable with the Cosmos ecosystem.

Penumbra integrates privacy with proof-of-stake through a novel private
delegation mechanism that provides staking derivatives, tax-efficient
staking, and on-chain governance with private voting. Penumbra connects to
the Cosmos ecosystem via IBC, acting as an ecosystem-wide shielded pool and
allowing private transactions in any IBC-compatible asset. Penumbra also
provides a private decentralized exchange, allowing users to use their assets
to provide liquidity in exchange for fees and liquidity rewards, or to
anonymously swap one type of asset to another. Swaps are performed using
sealed-bid batch auctions that prevent frontrunning and reveal only the net
flow across a pair of assets in each block, rather than each individual trade.

This website is a living document containing unfinished public research, and
is subject to revision.  The [updates section](./updates.md) has a list of
design updates.
